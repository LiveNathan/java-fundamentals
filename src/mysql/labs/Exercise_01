 * MySQL Exercise 1:
 *
 *      Using MySQLWorkbench,
 *
 *      1.) If you haven't already, create the college database as instructed here:
 *              https://platform.codingnomads.co/learn/mod/page/view.php?id=2133
 *      2.) Create a new table "students" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. first_name
 *          c. age
 *
 *      3.) Create a new table "teachers_students" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. student_id
 *          c. teacher_id
 I created this, but then later dropped it since it is data duplication. Students can be connected with teachers by the courses table.

 *
 *      4.) Create a new table "teachers" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. first_name
 *          c. last_name
 *          d. subject
 *
 *      5.) Create the appropriate foreign key constraints in the "teachers_students" table.
 *
 *      6.) Populate each table with at least 5 records. Use the "teachers_students" to associate various
 *          teachers with various students.
 *
 *      7.) Write queries (and paste them below) for each of the following tasks:
 *          a. select all students
 SELECT * FROM university.students;

 *          b. select all teacher who teach "Math" (choose a subject you included)
 SELECT * FROM university.teachers WHERE university.teachers.subject=3;

 *          c. use a join query to select all students with a certain teacher
USE university;
SELECT s.first_name
FROM students s
JOIN students_courses sc
ON s.student_id = sc.student_id
JOIN courses
ON sc.course_id = courses.id
JOIN teachers
ON courses.id = teachers.subject
WHERE teachers.last_name = "Adams";

 *          d. use a join query to select all students with taking a certain subject
 USE university;
 SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name
 FROM students s
 JOIN students_courses sc
 ON s.student_id = sc.student_id
 JOIN courses
 ON sc.course_id = courses.id
 WHERE courses.name = "geology";

 *          e. update a record in the student table
 USE university;
 UPDATE students
 SET age = 37
 WHERE student_id = 4;

 *          f. add a record to the teacher table
USE university;
INSERT INTO teachers (first_name, last_name, subject)
VALUES ("Achsah", "Rogerson", 3);

 *
 *       8.) Export the schema to a dump file and copy it to this folder.
university_schema (no data, just schema)
